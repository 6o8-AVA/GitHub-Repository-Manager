# Change Log : GitHub Repository Manager

## 1.6.5 - 2025-10-14

### Improvements

- Hidden organizations in both the **Cloned** and **Not Cloned** trees can now surface selected repositories while keeping the rest hidden.
- Updated hidden section messaging so you can quickly tell when an organization is hidden but exposing specific repositories.
- Persistence upgraded to remember per-organization visibility overrides across both trees.

## 1.6.4 - 2025-10-14

### New Features

- Added a **Clone into Managed Directory** command that guides you through cloning into the configured default directory, automatically creating the target folder when it is missing.

### Improvements

- Adds **Cloned / Others** tree to surface the same metadata as primary repositories, including dirtiness indicators and remote details.
- Updated repository timestamps to match GitHub by reading the latest commit on the default branch.
- Aligned context menu actions so hidden "Others" repositories retain the same local open and navigation commands as visible ones.
- Hardened the managed clone workflow to avoid failures when the destination folder hierarchy does not exist.

## 1.6.3 - 2025-10-13

README updated to be more clear about features and cleanup to remove original author's promotional content.

## 1.6.1

- Fix: 'setAsFavorite' is already registered [#50](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/pull/50).

## 1.6.0

- Added `Cloned - Others` tree for local repositories that aren't from the user or from an organization the user is part of. For now they must have a remote URL. Later I will add support for repositories without remote.
- Added `Delete` to cloned repositories' context menu. It has a confirmation and informs if the repository is dirty, but still, be careful!

## 1.5.1 - 2022-06-20

- Improved HEAD detection for repository cloning. It shall work for all the languages. [#42](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/42). Thanks, [lo-ca](https://github.com/lo-ca)!

## 1.5.0 - 2022-06-09

- Now using `globby` to find the dirs that contains .git. It's not only faster but fixes a strange bug where there wouldn't appear any cloned repositories.
- Removed `coloredIcons` option. It's just ugly if the repos don't have colors, certainly no one disabled that. Contact me if you did.
- Added `logs, src, lib, out, build` as default to `"githubRepositoryManager.directoriesToIgnore"`.
- Changed `"git.defaultCloneDirectory"` default from `3` to `2`.

## 1.4.0~1 - 2022-05-31

- Added button in the TreeView to set the "git.defaultCloneDirectory"! [#40](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/40) [#29](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/29)

## 1.3.3 - 2022-03-03

- Fixed the Remote HEAD obtaining for japanese Git - [#35](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/35). Thanks, [@YuuJinS](https://github.com/YuuJinS)!
- Fixed `tokenHidden` replace not being applied on all tokens in error messages.

## 1.3.2 - 2022-01-19

- Possible solution. Seems it was a git language output issue on `git remote show ...`. But no idea on why it isn't happenning on Dev.

## 1.3.1 - 2022-01-19

- Trying to fix #33 by setting specific dependencies version. Strangely, this error doesn't happen on dev.

## 1.3.0 - 2021/08/03

- Added support to create repositories for organizations the user has permission to.
- Organization repositories are now alphabetically ordered.
- Create repository and reload buttons now will only show up if user is logged.

## 1.2.0 - 2021/08/03

- Added "Create Repository for Current Files", our "Publish to GitHub". Finally, after more than a year, had the time, the will and the hacky ideas to have it working! [#2](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/2) Thanks [hediet](https://github.com/hediet) for the idea and the patience! ðŸ˜…

## 1.1.0 - 2021/07/25

- Fixed repositories without remote HEAD (new repositories, empty) being marked as dirty.
- Dirtiness may now be marked as `E`, for errors.
- Fixed master/main issue.
- Fixed [#22](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/22)

- Removed excess keywords in package.json

## 1.0.0 - 2021/07/23

- Added the new VS Code GitHub Authentication. (!)
- Added dirty repository indicator ([#16](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/16)). Being ok and validated, later I will add a 'Delete' context menu option to non-dirty cloned repos. Please report errors.
- Repositories in Tree View are now colored. There is a new option to turn that off and use the old monochromatic style.
- Now using `main` instead of `master` [#18](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/18)
- Fixed `Fork of` in repository tooltip not being bold.
- Fixed the Account tree view displaying a "not logged" view at the initial credentials load. Now shows a "Loading...", as happens while logging in.

## 0.6.1 - Feb 03, 2021

- Fixed [#15](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/15).
- Fixed [#21](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/21). Thanks for the issue, [xCONFLiCTiONx](https://github.com/xCONFLiCTiONx)!
- Updated dependency packages.

## 0.6.0 - Aug 29, 2020

- Fixed breaking bug in Windows. It was not allowing opening the cloned repos. (in [#13](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/13), but isn't actually the original error in #13. #13 looks a VsCode bug in revealFileInOs using the current focused file instead of the provided file path (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87804).)

Sorry, Windows users. It scares me when I think about how much time it has been happening. I will also fix the ugly repository tooltip spacing.

- Removed the cloned repository "Open Containing Directory" icon for now until VsCode fixes the API (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/105666). It can still be accessed with the right-click menu.

- Renamed aux.ts files to utils.ts. Windows doesn't allow 'aux' files.

- Fixed infinite 'Loading...' on error ([#12](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/issues/12)). Also, if "git.defaultCloneDirectory" is not set, a message will be displayed under Cloned tree view.

- Fixed some other minor stuff

## 0.5.0 - Aug 06, 2020

Added support to organizations repositories ([#10](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/pull/10))! You will need to re-OAuth again or add the 'org:read' to your Personal Acess Token permissions.

Many thanks to [jonathan-fielding](https://github.com/jonathan-fielding) for this feature!

## 0.4.0 - Jul 08, 2020

Added 'one click to clone' setting ([#7](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/pull/7))

Added support to SSH cloned repositories to be found ([#9](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/pull/9))

Thanks to [jonathan-fielding](https://github.com/jonathan-fielding) for both pull requests!

## 0.3.6 - May 22, 2020 -> Today was the day of quick and small changes

Reworked the Repositories Tree View Item Tooltip. Looks better now. Unfortunatelly, the ":" aren't perfectly alignable, as the font is not monospaced. Yeah, it annoys me too. We have to accept it!!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager/master/images/changelog/0_3_6.png" alt="0.3.6">

## 0.3.5 - May 22, 2020

Clone command seems to be fully fixed. Now, on repository commit, it will have "master" as the default destination.

## 0.3.4 - May 22, 2020

Quick fix on Activity Bar name. It was still being called GitHub Repository Loader (early name) instead of Manager.

## 0.3.3 - May 22, 2020

Fixed private repositories not showing as private.

Added "Created" and "Updated" dates on repository tooltip.

Thanks for the idea, hediet!

## 0.2.7 - May 12, 2020

Fixed username.github.io repositories not being found by the Cloned Repository Searcher. Thanks, u/tHeSiD!

## 0.2.1 ~ 0.2.6 - May 11, 2020

Quick README fixes.

Logo updated again. I looked at my screen while I was a little slid in the chair and I got this idea of the gradient. "Blue gradient. Nice. Now let's add pink or purple." and I kept moving two linear gradients and changing its colors until it looked nice on both of my monitors. lol

## 0.2.0 - May 11, 2020

Fixed Cloned Repositories Search not working with some remotes.

Changed project logo.

Improved README.

- Added usage .gif (that took my time to get it "ok"!)

Added error message if the extension can't open the OAuth callback server.
