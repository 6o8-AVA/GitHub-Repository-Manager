Multiple sorting options to organize your repositories your way:

- Sort by last updated date
- Sort alphabetically
- Convenient sorting submenu in repositories view

### ‚è∞ **Relative Time Display**
See when repositories were last updated at a glance with human-readable time formatting (years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds ago) - displayed alongside the dirty state indicator.

### üè¢ **Enhanced Organization Repository Management**
Better handling of organization repositories with improved label display and dedicated utility functions for seamless organization workflows.

### üóÑÔ∏è **Automatic Archived Repository Filtering**
Keeps your workspace clean and focused on active projects by automatically filtering out archived repositories from both user and organization lists.

### ‚ûï **Create Repositories Directly in VS Code**
Create new GitHub repositories for your personal account or organizations you belong to without leaving your editor.

### üîé **Smart Cloned Repository Detection**
Automatically discovers and lists all your cloned GitHub repositories from your configured clone directory, supporting both HTTPS and SSH remotes.

### üè¢ **Full Organization Support**
View, manage, and create repositories for organizations you're a member of, with proper permission handling.

### üé® **Visual Repository Icons**
Color-coded repository icons provide quick visual distinction in the tree view, making navigation easier.

### üóëÔ∏è **Safe Repository Deletion**

<h2><b> Cloned Repositories Search </b></h2>

To make your GitHub cloned repositories show up in the **Cloned** tree view, you will need to set the **`"git.defaultCloneDirectory"`** in your VSCode `settings.json` to the path your cloned repositories are located (they may be deeply located there).

**1.4.0** - there is now a button to set this config interactively!

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28177550/171236229-86a8fbd4-d21d-4b96-938a-ff0f09a59948.png)

<h2><b> Creating a repository </b></h2>

By hovering the **REPOSITORIES** tree view title, a **+** button appears. Click on it, enter the new repository name, description (optional) and visibility. On success, you may choose to clone the new repository.

If you are a member of at least one organization that allows you to create repositories for it, it will be asked, before the repository name input, to pick the new repository owner: your own account or one of those organizations.

<h2><b> Creating a repository for current project </b></h2>

![](images/readme/publish.png)

You may create a GitHub repository and push your current project within the same flow. If there are multiple folders in your workspace that may be published to GitHub, it will be prompted to pick one.

There are 2 possible cases that allows using that publish functionality:

1) **Your project doesn't have a Git yet.** After entering the repository name, description and visibility, the repository will be created, the git will be initialized for the workspace folder, `main` branch will be created and selected, GitHub remote will be added as `origin` and your files will then be pushed to it.

2) **Your project has a Git, but it hasn't a remote yet.** After filling the repository information, it will be checked if your git HEAD is `master`. If so, it will ask if you want the branch to be renamed to `main`. Then the repository will be created, the GitHub remote is added as `origin` and your code is pushed.

<h1 align="center"> Settings </h1>

##### Default: **false**

- ## Default Clone Directory Maximum Depth

##### _"githubRepositoryManager.clonedRepositoriesSearch.defaultCloneDirectoryMaximumDepth"_

      Changelog

<h2 align="center">
  
**Note**: This is a fork of the [original extension](https://github.com/SrBrahma/GitHub-Repository-Manager) by Henrique Bruno, maintained and published by 6o8 Ascendant Versioning Authority (6o8 AVA).

</h2>

<h1 align="center"> Roadmap </h1>

- Search and clone public repositories

- Visualize without cloning (useful for getting some value or checking something from some repository)

- "Order by" (alphabetically, stars, your open frequency, created on, updated on) in top menu

- Search repository by name

- Fetch repositories on demand - Some devs have hundreds or thousands of repos. Instead of fetching all of them on init and displaying all of them together, there could be a \[1..100\], \[101, 200\] tree system, for both on demand fetch and display.
